## Author(s)

- Jonathan Kennel (University of Guelph G360 Group)

## Modeled locations

The following locations were modelled (check modelled locations):

- [] Netherlands
- [x] Germany
- [ ] Sweden 1
- [ ] Sweden 2
- [ ] USA

## Model description

Linear regression model with distributed lag components

## Model workflow to reproduce

The code necessary to reproduce the output can be found in the .qmd file of this repository.

## Supplementary model data used

No additional data was used.

## Estimation of effort

Please provide an (rough) estimate of the time it took to develop the models (e.g., read in data, pick a model 
structure, etcetera) and calibrate the parameters (if any). If possible, please also state the computational resources that were required. This was done on a MacBook Air 2020 M1.

| Location    | Development time (hrs) | Calibration time (s) | Total time (hrs) | 
|-------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Netherlands |                        |                      |                  |
| Germany     | ~ 4                    |   < 5                | 04:00:05         |
| Sweden 1    |                        |                      |                  |
| Sweden 2    |                        |                      |                  |
| USA         |                        |                      |                  |
