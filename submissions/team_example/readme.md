## Modeled locations

We modelled the following locations :

- [x] Netherlands
- [X] Germany
- [X] Sweden 1
- [X] Sweden 2
- [X] USA

## Model description

We used the BC-MODWT-DL models  as described in detail in Chidepudi et al. (2022). This is a XX type of model. The model is 
implemented in the XX software package that was used here.

## Model workflow to reproduce
Scripts necessary to reproduce the work is submitted in the scripts folder

Please provide a detailed description of the modeling workflow here, in such a way that the results may be 
reproduced independently by others. The preferred way to ensure reproducibility is to provide a commented script and 
environment settings.

## Supplementary model data used

Please describe any additional information that was used to model the hydraulic head time series. If no additional 
information was used, please state: 'No additional information was obtained and/or used.'

## Estimation of effort

Please provide an (rough) estimate of the time it took to develop the models (e.g., read in data, pick a model 
structure, etcetera) and calibrate the parameters (if any). If possible, please also state the computational resources that 
were required.

| Location    | Development time (hrs) | Calibration time (s) | Total time (hrs) | 
|-------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Netherlands | ~ 2                    | 40                   | 02:00:40         |
| Germany     |                        |                      |                  |
| Sweden 1    |                        |                      |                  |
| Sweden 2    |                        |                      |                  |
| USA         |                        |                      |                  |
